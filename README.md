# GA-Optimized MLP

A MLP (MultiLayer Perceptron) is one of the most commonly used algorithms of Artificial Neural Networks. It's trainning is done by adjusting the weights for each connection between the hidden layers of artificial neurons using some optimization algorithm. This code is an example of how to use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as a way to train an MLP.
